WireFrame:

MVP: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.

    1. Build the skeleton with HTML, create CSS code for some styling, and JS functions and Axios for getting data and user interaction.

    2. Add and use Axios  to make requests from external data base and pull that information onto the DOM for it to be used in app and for the app to have actual purpose.

    3. Make app responsive using at least one @mediaquery.

    4. Put on Surge

    5. Commit everyday. Daily logs of what worked and didnt work

    6. README.md file for all information as to how to utilize the app and what it does. Also any links that were used.


Post-MVP:A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.

    1. Build app with more style
    2. Add pokemon theme song if able to
    3. Add links to other pokemon resources and direct it to the appropriate page. 


Goals: 

    Day 1. Clone repo
          Start and complete comments for the skeleton of HTML, CSS, and JS to have clear understanding of the steps needed to finish the app implementing all the three languages.
    Day 2. (Start the difficult JS coding)
            Add functions and implement Axios to retrieve data from external data base. (Check if data is able to be displayed)
    Day 3. Continue to work on JS functions and   Axios 
            Retouch CSS to make app cohesive and work well with JS.
    Day 4.  Final touches to project
    Day 5. Add any bonuses to project if I can and have time.


TimeFrame: How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Components should be broken down into a maximum of 3 hours time blocks.

      Day 1. Initial HTML, CSS, and JS setup - 3hr;
        Comments - 1 hr; Adding Flexbox/Grid to app  and getting it to work- 4 hrs

      Day 2. JS function and Axios request to     work (this will be the most difficult for me)- 8+ hrs

      Day 3. Continue to work on JS functions and Axios - 5 hrs; also work on Flexbox/Grid more - 3 hrs

      Day 4.  Continue Flexbox/Grid - 3 hrs;Make sure everything works! Work on any Debugging issues for JS and Axios - 4 hrs; additional research - 1 hr

      Day 5. If I have time I will work on bonuses. I will add more styling and images to the app. Deployment and researching JS for better implementations - 8 hrs

      Day 6. Hopefully no more coding. Looking over all the work. - 5 hrs

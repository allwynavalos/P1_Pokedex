### MVP: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.

    1. Build the skeleton with HTML, create CSS code for some styling, and JS functions and Axios for getting data and user interaction.

    2. Add and use Axios  to make requests from external data base and pull that information onto the DOM for it to be used in app and for the app to have actual purpose.

    3. Make app responsive using at least one @mediaquery.

    4. Put on Surge

    5. Commit everyday. Daily logs of what worked and didnt work

    6. README.md file for all information as to how to utilize the app and what it does. Also any links that were used.


### Post-MVP:A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.

    1. Build app with more style
    2. Add pokemon theme song if able to
    3. Add links to other pokemon resources and direct it to the appropriate page. 
    4. Possbly adding another API for the Pokemon pictures to display


Goals: 

    Day 1. Clone repo
          Start and complete comments for the skeleton of HTML, CSS, and JS to have clear understanding of the steps needed to finish the app implementing all the three languages.
    Day 2. (Start the difficult JS coding)
            Add functions and implement Axios to retrieve data from external data base. (Check if data is able to be displayed)
    Day 3. Continue to work on JS functions and   Axios 
            Retouch CSS to make app cohesive and work well with JS.
    Day 4.  Final touches to project
    Day 5. Add any bonuses to project if I can and have time.
    
## Priority Matrix: 
A graph of your intended areas of development (Pseudocoding, Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Testing, etc) plotted on an X/Y axis where X represents time to completion and Y represents priority. Use a professional tool or upload a well drawn image using an image hosting site such as Cloudinary or a similar hosting service.
